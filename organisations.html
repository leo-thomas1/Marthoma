      <p class="org-about">
        At Horeb Mar Thoma Church, our Sunday School is more than just a place of learning ‚Äî it is a nurturing space
        where faith, values, and character are built for life. We believe that guiding our younger generation with the
        teachings of the Bible and Christian principles is essential to shaping them into compassionate, responsible,
        and mature individuals who make a positive impact in society.<br>

        Sunday School is conducted every Sunday at 8:00 AM with eight levels of classes, from Nursery to ProudaVakup,
        and each level is divided into two sections ‚Äî First Year and Second Year. Children are allotted to their classes
        based on age, with Nursery being the entry-level class and ProudaVakup as the highest class. The syllabus for
        each class is formulated by the Mar Thoma Sunday School Samajam, Thiruvalla, and textbooks are also provided by
        the Samajam. To ensure systematic learning, two examinations are conducted annually ‚Äî the Half-Yearly and the
        Final Exam. This structured system ensures that every child progresses gradually in faith, knowledge, and
        character as they grow.<br>

        Through engaging lessons, interactive activities, songs, and fellowship, we aim to instill strong moral
        foundations and a deep love for God in the hearts of our children. Our dedicated teachers, with prayerful
        commitment, mentor each child to grow in wisdom, faith, and kindness, preparing them to face life‚Äôs challenges
        with courage and grace. The Sunday School at Horeb is not only about spiritual education but also about building
        friendships, developing talents, and learning to serve others selflessly ‚Äî shaping the leaders of tomorrow in
        both faith and life.

        Songs in worship have the power to prepare our hearts, inspire our spirits, and draw us closer to the presence
        of the Lord. Our choir uses this gift of music to guide the congregation into a deeper atmosphere of prayer,
        praise, and thanksgiving.<br>

        Every hymn and melody is offered as an act of devotion, transforming each service into a spiritually moving
        experience. With dedication and unity, the choir strives to glorify God and lead His people in worship that
        truly touches the soul.
