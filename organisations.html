      <p class="org-about">
        At Horeb Mar Thoma Church, our Sunday School is more than just a place of learning ‚Äî it is a nurturing space where faith, values, and character are built for life. We believe that guiding our younger generation with the teachings of the Bible and Christian principles is essential to shaping them into compassionate, responsible, and mature individuals who make a positive impact in society.

Through engaging lessons, interactive activities, songs, and fellowship, we aim to instill strong moral foundations and a deep love for God in the hearts of our children. Our dedicated teachers, with prayerful commitment, mentor each child to grow in wisdom, faith, and kindness, preparing them to face life‚Äôs challenges with courage and grace.

The Sunday School at Horeb is not only about spiritual education but also about building friendships, developing talents, and learning to serve others selflessly ‚Äî shaping the leaders of tomorrow in both faith and life.

        The Choir of Horeb Mar Thoma Church plays a vital role in enriching our worship experience. Through heartfelt singing and harmonious music, the choir uplifts our Holy Mass and prayer services, helping the congregation connect more deeply with God.

Songs in worship have the power to prepare our hearts, inspire our spirits, and draw us closer to the presence of the Lord. Our choir uses this gift of music to guide the congregation into a deeper atmosphere of prayer, praise, and thanksgiving.

Every hymn and melody is offered as an act of devotion, transforming each service into a spiritually moving experience. With dedication and unity, the choir strives to glorify God and lead His people in worship that truly touches the soul.
