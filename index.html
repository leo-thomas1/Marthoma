      <span class="highlight">About</span> Horeb Mar Thoma Church
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the early days, the church that Syrian Christians of Thiruvalla congregated for worship was at Niranam,
      which was one of the seven churches established by St. Thomas at Malankara: Kodungalloor, Kollam, Paloor, Paravoor, Thekkanpallippuram, Niranam, and Nilackal.
      <br><br>
      Later, a cathedral church was established at Thiruvalla Paliekkara in 1815 A.D. and holy services were conducted there.
      This church was burned and destroyed by the Pathtillathil Pottis, the lords of those days. The parishionersâ€™ petition made Colonel Munro,
      a British resident, intervene and collect a fine of 6000 Calions from the culprits. Half of this amount was used to renovate the church,
      which is the present-day Paliekkara Church.
